                      <p>
                        Sauce Labs was founded in 2008 by Jason Huggins, co-creator of Selenium (the open source standard for automated testing frameworks) and Steve Hazel, current CTO. They set out to create a cloud-based platform for automated testing to free development teams from the hassle and cost of testing so they can focus on innovating their core capabilities.
                      </p>
                      <p>Jason was using Selenium to do browser testing, and the process of testing the apps in different browsers was taking too long. The problem was that all the testing was being done on one machine, so he split the tests onto 4 different machines, effectively running the tests in parallel, which cut the time drastically. That's what started Selenium, and eventually what started Sauce Labs.</p>

					<h3>CI/CD Cycle</h3>

                    <img src="assets/images/sauceCI2.png" style="border:0; text-align:center; background:none;">
                    <p style="text-align:center;">Continuous Integration/Continuous Development</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                      <p>Sauce Labs integreates inteself into the Continuous Delivery/Continuous Integration cycle, seamlessly. Traditionally, testing and QA are bottlenecks for application delivery and release, where any problems found have to start from the beginning of the cycle, and in the end have to bed tested again. The real bottlneck though isn't what happens when a bug is found, it's the time consuming nature of writing tests for a product that is ever changing itself. It's the time it takes to perform each test, it's setting up the infrastructure that allows those tests to be run on a variety of platforms that your application runs on.</p>
                      <p>Sauce Labs takes away those worries though. With Selenium and Appium testing, we remove the barrier of time consuming test writing, and with Sauce Labs itself, we remove the need to have a propietary infrastructure, just to run our tests. Sauce Labs provides the infrastructure for you, allowing you to test on a variety of platforms in a speedy manner. So you can focus on development, and releases, and leave the testing to Sauce Labs.</p>

				  <h3>What is Selenium?</h3>
                  <p>Developed in 2004 by Jason Huggins at ThoughtWorks.</p>
				  <p>Browser automation framework used for testing.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Simulate site interaction</li>
                    <li>Automate Application Testing</li>
                  </ul>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>History: Was developed in 2004 as an internal tool at ThoughtWorks, by Jason Huggins. It's gone through a couple stages of evolution at this point, with numerous other contributors, but it has always facilitated and simplified application testing.(Hammant, Simon Stewart, etc)</p>
                    <p>So <b>how</b> does Sauce Labs faciltate your testing? Selenium is the core testing framework that Sauce Labs runs for you on a variety of Browser and OS combinations.</p>
                    <p>Selenium is the testing framework that provides the actual language and ability to test interations on a browser. We use its API to write scripts in our preferred language, and then the commands in those scripts simulate interaction on a browser, either locally on your own computer, or remotely.</p>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    So where do I actually run my selenium scripts? Well you can always run it locally - when you run a script it can pull up a browser thats on your machines, access your application, and run the test. But then you're restricted to the OS that is actually on your machine, as well as the browser versions and types that are available for that OS as well. It would be difficult to run IE on Ubuntu!
                    <p>In order to test across browsers or OS's Selenium actually offers software - a Selenium Server - that can help you create a Selenium farm - that is, a server farm that has VMs running with all of these different possible OS and browser combinations.</p>
                    <p>But that's pretty painful and time consuming to set up and manage all on your own, not to even mention the cost of hardware.</p>
                    <p>Sauce Labs handles all of that stuff for you. They essentially run a Selenium Grid themselves and rent it out to their customers to run their Selenium and Appium tests on. </p>

                    <p>So why should you bother using Sauce Labs? On a basic level, they'll save you the hassle of setting up your own testing infrastructure. But they also pile on a ton of additional features as well, such as Security, and recorded tests as well. Sauce Labs provides security through it's Sauce Connect technology, which allows you host your applicaiton locally, and Sauce Labs will connect with your site remotely to run tests. It sends commands through an encrypted tunnel, ensuring that no information is leaked.</p>

                    <p>Traditionally, testing was done manually, with a user just going into the application and manually clicking on elements and making sure nothing broke. Sauce Labs allows you to do manual tests, whether you use it to actually test your product, or to plan out what sort of tests you are going to run on your site. With the manual testing, you still get the same great features that you get with the automated tests as well, such as the video recording, screenshots captured, and logs.</p>

                    <li>Selenium Client API - what we will be using today, as part of the Selenium Webdriver. It allows tests to be written in a variety of programming languages, so it enables us to write our tests in Java. These are the language specific bindings.</li>
                    <li>Selenium WebDriver - The Selenium WebDriver is the client that accepts the commands via the API or in the Selenium scripting language and sends those commands to a browser.</li>
                    <li>Selenium Grid - this is the Selenium Server, which allows tests to to use web browsers on other machines - so this is what Sauce Labs does for you, but on a very large scale and with a lot of options for machines and browsers - not restricted to just one version either</li>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>The only difference between how Selenium works locally or remotely is where the browser is opened to exceute the commands. Locally, the driver will just open a brwoser based off of the type driver used in the script. Remotely, in particular on Sauce Labs, the remote webdriver is used to pass the script commands along to a remote browser, whose type is set through additional commands. With Sauce Labs, you'll have the additional step of the test asset creation at the end. These are the videos, screenshots, and logs that recorded your test.</p>

                      <p>Tests might fail because the elements that are expected for the next step haven't loaded into the browser yet. It's good to have an explicit wait time in this case, as after a click, it can be variable how long an element could be loaded onto the page.</p>
                      <p>For example, when we click on that drop-down that has an ID of ham, it takes time for the options on the drop down to render. We would need to set a wait in order for the action on the drop down to succeed.</p>
                      <p>While we may not have waits in our current script, we will take a look at them in a later module.</p>

                      <p>For those of you who are not familiar with XPATH, it is the language used to locate nodes in an XML doc. HTML can be an implementation of XHTML (XML), so you can use XPATH to locate elements on a page. Most people use the XPATH to locate an element because the element may not have an ID or name attribute to locate it easily.
                      </p>
                      <p>The danger in using XPATH lies in how it finds elements, which is essentially where is the element in the hierarchy of the page. If that element moves during the development of the application, then your tests are at risk of breaking, if they XPATH. It's generally recommended to not use XPATHs unless you don't have any other choice.</p>

                    There are many situations in which your test script may run ahead of the website or application you're testing, resulting in timeouts and a failing test. For example, you may have a dynamic content element that, after a user clicks on it, a loading appears for five seconds. If your script isn't written in such a way as to account for that five second load time, it may fail because the next interactive element isn't available yet. The general recommended solution for this is to use explicit waits.

                  <h3>What is a Testing Framework?</h3>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>A test automation framework is a scaffold comprised of libraries, dependecies, drivers, and helper scripts that facilitate the execution of Selenium test scripts.</p>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Ok so what does that mean? It's essentially just a bunch of additional libraries we can use in conjunction with our script for several cases:</p>
                    <li>Record your data - Frameworks often have, or can have a way for you to output the results of your test scripts for you, rather than writing them by hand</li>
                    <li>Talk to external applications - you can include external libraries in your framework to talk to and send results to places like Sauce Labs</li>

                  <h3>Test Driven Development vs. Behavior Driven Development</h3>
                  <p>TDD: A developer writes the test, and then writes code, and tests that code continuously, until the test passes.</p>
                  <p>BDD: A way to plan and develop code similar to TDD, but allows teams to include non-technical members when writing tests for scenarios and features</p>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>In the QA/Test industry, there are a couple of different ways of thinking about how to develop applications with testing in mind. One of those is TDD, where you write a test, and then write the code until the test passes. Antoher variant is to plan the same kind of testing, but on a higher level, basically written in a more colloquial manner though.</p>
                    <p>TDD is also somewhat synonymous with "test first" development. BDD means writing tests that read like a book, almost in full sentences, so people can understand precisely what a test is trying to accomplish.</p>

                </section>

                <section>
                  <h3>TDD Planning Example</h3>
                  <p>Sauce_counter() needs to count the number of sauces inputted</p>
                  <p>Pasta_counter() needs to count the number of pastas inputted</p>
                  <p>sNpComparer() needs to compare the counts and make sure that they are equal</p>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>This is an example of TDD, because we have idenfitfied features of the program that need to be made, and we have a function for each one, which details very explicity what each will do.</p>
                  </aside>
                </section>


                <section>
                  <h3>BDD Planning Example</h3>

                  <p>Feature: Pasta and Sauce Matchmaker</p>
                  <p>Scenario: Some sauces</p>
                  <ul><p>Given I have 5 different kinds of Sauce</p>
                  <p>When I have 5 different kinds of Pasta</p>
                  <p>Then my chef will be happy</p></ul>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>This is an example of BDD, which uses the Given, When, Then, method of planning. It details the actual goals of what the application or feature needs to accomplishes, in terms of a user story, rather than explicit functions. In this method of planning, we are making sure that the end goal or the business objective will be accomplished.</p>

                      <p>A common element of Selenium scripts are Asserts. Asserts come with whichever testing framwork that you have decided to work with. They generally check whether a particular value is true or not. For example, if the uncheckedboxed state returns true, then that means the assert will pass. It's basically the test itself. If an assert fails, that generally means the test has failed as well. We're going to try using asserts ourselves.</p>

                     <p>Autonomous: Tests should be independent of other tests.</p>

                     <aside class="notes">

                       <p>Short - If you have a test suite of 100 tests running concurrently on 100 VMs, then the time it will take to run the entire suite will be determined by the longest/slowest test case. Keeping your tests small ensures that your suite will run efficiently and provide you with results faster. </p>
                       <p>Atomic - The test makes clear exactly what it is that you're testing. If the test fails, then you should also have a very clear idea of what needs to be fixed. </p>
                       <p>Autonomous - Tests should not be dependent on the results of one test to run successfully. In addition, an autonomous test should use its own data to test against, and not create potential conflicts with other tests over the same data.  </p>

                     <aside class="notes">
                       <p>Performance testing serves to answer questions such as, can your application server handle a particular load, and does it behave as expected when you push it to its limit? These types of tests are better undertaken with a testing infrastructure that has been specifically developed for performance testing, so all baseline performance metrics are well established and understood before you start the test.</p>

                         Sometimes we interact with particular elements in our application repeatedly. The nature of applications is that they change over time as well. Instead of writing the same code for the same interacctions, we can add a level of abstraction with page objects.

                     <p>Avoid dependencies between tests</p>
                     <ul><li>If you chain tests together, when one at the top fails, then they will all fail.</li></ul>
                     <p>Use Frameworks</p>
                     <ul><li>Frameworks include helpful libraries and functionality that can help you make the most of parallelization.</li></ul>
                     <aside class="notes">
                       <p>Running tests in parallel is the secret Sauce for accelerating your development process and creating a continuous integration/continuous delivery pipeline.</p>
                       <p>One of the main features that Sauce Labs offers is parallelization, the ability to run serveral scripts at once on a variety of platforms. Since tests and commands are sent remotely, these tests take longer to run individually, but with parallelization, we can run them all at once. That is, we can start them all at the same time, which cuts down on the total time tests would normally take, saving time and money for your teams and business.</p>
                       <p>It's good to avoid dependencies between tests. This goes along with the atomic testing strategy, where we want to create autonomous tests, so that they don't depend on each other, and when one fails, then we know exactly what failed.</p>
